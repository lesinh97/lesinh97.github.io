## About me and my projects

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/avatar.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Started learning in specialized chemistry class at High school, I've been dreamed of being a doctor, a bachelor or even a chemistry teacher.
But something happened, I'm here as a *developer*! <br/>
In 2015, I've got into **Danang University of Science and Technology**, lots of false starts, missteps and mistakes. But the turbulent start always remind me to keep following my path. And that why you pursue something is equally as important as what you pursue. <br/>
I gained the ability to lift myself from those circumstances by seeking and obtaining, with the caring help of my parents, my friends, my girl, a good education.

In fact that, I'm not passionately thorough in my writings, including every detail I felt was needed to complete the story. But writing is using your imagination on paper, flows through the keyboard, so, why not? <br/>

On social media, we may share our own thoughts and advance our image notwithstanding spreading musings for different associations and affiliations. With such a critical number of associations with people and relationship on social media, our experience can be over-burden with a considerable measure of information.
