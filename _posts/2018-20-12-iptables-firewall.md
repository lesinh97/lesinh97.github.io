## What is Firewall?
*References from Cisco Network.*

A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.

Firewalls have been a first line of defense in network security for over 25 years. They establish a barrier between secured and controlled internal networks that can be trusted and untrusted outside networks, such as the Internet. 

A firewall can be hardware, software, or both.

## Some attack technique...

The facts that these lines of code are very simple and its just what I've learnt in university.
- IP spoofing.
- Steath scan (TCP/SYN)
- Ping flood (ICPM flood)
- HTTP DDoS
